> "A view or opinion that is incorrect because it is based on faulty thinking or understanding."

Too often, people forget the circumstances leading to misconception. We are judged by what we say or do in the moment without thought towards the context or the events leading up to it. Take the example of a convenience store robbery, the suspect is tried and charged with the crime committed in the moment, though the judge and jury subconsciously or consciously understand the given context. On the other hand, when two people/groups/ideologies clash, it's unusual for most to take into consideration what exactly caused this apparent "faulty thinking or understanding". This often leads to a debate where each side is trying to prove its point without tailoring the arguments to their audiences.

Debate as a system of discussion needs to be revamped. In debate competitions, whether varsity or political, the opposing sides are to dig into their views and convince the audience when they should be trying to compel the other side to switch over. Too many politicians change their own views to match the majority vote rather than trying to change the majority opinion to match what they truly believe to be in the benefit of the community. The idea of taking sides is toxic to the idea of debate, since the purpose of debate is to change the opposing sides view.

Through the rise of Big Data and it's statistical power we can, in theory at least, target these more specific arguments towards the people they'd most affect. We would be able to change peoples minds or push them in the "right" direction more efficiently. For example, someone who has had unpleasant run-ins with the police might have different reasons for not supporting them than someone brought up being taught that way of thinking. This applies to the other side as well. If a proportion of the police force consists of officers with preconceived notions or generalizations of a group of people or officers that came to these conclusions on their own for any number of reasons, they would respond differently to differently phrased or assembled arguments.

Obviously on a large scale, this type of power can be greatly abused, as is suspected with the alleged voter manipulation in the last US presidential election. But as with anything else, we need to take the good with the bad while trying to minimize the ill effects. Targeted Arguments could be the next step in education and re-education and we definitely need to bring context back into the equation. Without it debate can more frequently end in deadlock, with neither side convinced or willing to change their views.
