Hey,

Welcome to my tiny site. I'm a Computer Systems Undergraduate at Carleton University expected to graduate in December 2019. This site is just a way for me to keep a public log of my projects, no matter their nature. I hope to be updating whenever something worth posting about comes up but I might end up with a backlog of posts that I want to get to.
