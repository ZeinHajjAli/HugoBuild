Hey,

Welcome to my tiny site. I'm a Computer Systems Undergraduate at Carleton University expected to graduate in April 2020. This site is just a way for me to keep a public log of my projects, no matter their nature. I hooope to be updating whenever something worth posting about comes up but I might end up witha backlog of posts that I want to get to. You can contact me using any of the links on the homepage, as well as @zeinhajjali on Instagram.
