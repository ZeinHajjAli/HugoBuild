The statistics website FiveThirtyEight publishes weekly math and/or programming challenges in their 'Culture' section every week under the title of 'The Riddler'. I have started trying to solve these problems week by week as they come out. The Riddler for the week of September 13th, 2019 was called "Can You Help Dakota Jones Raid The Lost Ark?". Each Riddler challenge come in two parts, the first is the Express, which is a shorter challenge that can usually be solved by hand, the second is the Classic which is usually a little tougher and might need some programming or scripting to solve. 



My first try at solving an older Riddler challenge was the Classic challenge of the week of May 19th, 2019. That solution can be found [here](https://zeinhajjali.com/RiddlerSolutions/BeatTheNightKing/). 


The [Riddler Classic](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-help-dakota-jones-raid-the-lost-arc/) for the week of September 13th, 2019 is as follows:

> The challenge is to find the longest string of letters in which (1) every pair of consecutive letters is a two-letter state or territory abbreviation, and (2) no state abbreviation occurs more than once. For example, Guam, Utah and Texas can be combined into the valid four-letter string GUTX. Another valid string is ALAK (Alabama, Louisiana and Alaska), while ALAL (Alabama, Louisiana and Alabama) is invalid because it includes the same state, Alabama, twice.



My solution to this challenge can be found [here](https://zeinhajjali.com/RiddlerSolutions/DakotaJones/classic).
