The Northern Nomad Systems Integration (NNSI) project has ended, and the final report has been submitted to the supervising professor and second reader. The project did not warrant a Github page. Instead, I have made the final report available for reading [**here**](/media/NNSI/ZeinHajjAli-NNSI-FinalReport.pdf), or for download [**here**](https://github.com/ZeinHajjAli/ZeinHajjAli.github.io/raw/master/media/NNSI/ZeinHajjAli-NNSI-FinalReport.pdf). 

Any questions about the project can be directed to me at 
[zeinhajjali@outlook.com](mailto:zeinhajjali@outlook.com).
