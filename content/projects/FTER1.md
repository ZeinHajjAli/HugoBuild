The statistics website FiveThirtyEight publishes weekly math and/or programming challenges in thier 'culture' section every week under the title of 'The Riddler'. I have started trying to solve these problems week by week as they come out. The Riddler for the week of September 13th, 2019 was called "Can You Help Dakota Jones Raid The Lost Ark?". Each Riddler challenge come in two parts, the first is the Express, which is a shorter challenge that can usually be solved by hand, the second is the Classic which is usually a little tougher and might need some programming or scripting to solve. 



My first try at solving an older Riddler challenge was the Classic challenge of the week of May 19th, 2019. That solution can be found [here](https://zeinhajjali.com/RiddlerSolutions/BeatTheNightKing/).
