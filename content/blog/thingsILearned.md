As 2019 comes to an end, I thought it would be nice to go over a few concepts that I learned or improved on during the course of the year. The end of the decade also happens to coincide with the end of my undergrad years at Carleton University. Right now, I'm in the middle for studying for the last of my finals and trying to decide what I want to do after graduation. So obviously, this is the perfect time to write a blog post for the site.
