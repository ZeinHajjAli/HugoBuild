I am not artistic. It took me my whole life to accept it, but I've finally figured it out. Throughout my life I've taken up countless "hobbies", some of which are artistic, while others are technical. During the past week, I've realized that the reason I take up so many hobbies and never stick to them is that I like to learn the conceptual and unchanging aspects of them, then move on to something different. For example, I took up photography, bought a new DSLR, and went out to take pictures. But more than that, I spent loads of time online trying to understand every little thing about how the camera manipulated light and the relationships between the different components. Once I learned all I could, I tried for a time to take more artistic photos, but I'd always go back to taking the same picture again and again with different settings just to see how it all affects the photo. I've realized that I would make better use of my time and money by experimenting with different hobbies using cheaper parts or materials. I'll be using this blog to assemble a catalog of all the different interests I've had over the years, as well as listing all the concepts I've learned so that each post may be used to teach a beginner about a certain subject. There will be no schedule or timetable for any of this, I will be posting a new subject any time I'm free or interested.
