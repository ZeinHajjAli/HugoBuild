Starting in the Fall semester of 2019, I will be taking a course at Carleton University on machine learning. The course description revealed that we will be working through 'The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book' by Andriy Burkov. Seeing this, I decided to get a head start and go through as much of the book as I can on my own. I feel like this will be a great opportunity to learn about and implement a topic I've been very interested in since I heard about it.

I will be updating a repository with examples and exercises from the book, as well as adding side projects and some of my own experimentation.

The repo can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ZeinHajjAli/MachineLearning).
