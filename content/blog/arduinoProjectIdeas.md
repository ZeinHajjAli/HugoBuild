Today I received my order of an Arduino Uno R3 kit. I’ve got a few ideas of some projects to work on. Some of these I haven’t found anything already online for. Might be a chance to build something that hasn’t been done in the same way before:

* Arduino film camera (homemade shutter and all).
* Robotic arm built from scrap around the house.
* A printer that really works (no, like really works).

If I find that these go really well, I might order something like a ATtiny to flash and build a real prototype, specifically the printer.
